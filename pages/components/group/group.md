Group | Compose elements and components in flex container

### Interactive Demo

Group allows you to compose any elements and components in a flex container. Use these props to change elements position
inside Group:

* **position** controls `justify-content` property
* **grow** `flex-grow` property, items will never wrap to next line if set to `True`
* **spacing** controls space between elements - predefined values from `theme.spacing` or number for spacing in px
* **noWrap** controls `flex-wrap` property and if set to true prevents elements from wrapping on next line once space on
  current line was exceeded
* **direction** controls `flex-direction`: row (default) for horizontal orientation, column for vertical
