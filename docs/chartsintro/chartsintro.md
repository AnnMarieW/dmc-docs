### CSS Extensions

As of DMC 1.2.0, Chart component styles are bundled automatically, so you no longer need to include a separate CSS file.
If you're using an older version of DMC, refer to the [migration guide](/migration) for instructions on including optional stylesheets.

### Based on recharts

Most of the chart components are based on [recharts](https://recharts.org/) library. If you need advanced features that are not covered in dmc charts documentation, please refer to the [recharts documentation](https://recharts.org/en-US/api) for more information.
