### üéâ Dash Mantine Components 2.0.0 (Based on Mantine v8)

We‚Äôre excited to announce a new release of Dash Mantine Components! This update brings a range of new components, 
enhanced features, and improvements to make building beautiful Dash apps even easier. 

### Migration Guide

This version is built on [Mantine 8](https://mantine.dev/changelog/8-0-0/), so there are some breaking changes, but as promised, far fewer than in previous
major releases.  See our [Migration Guide](/migration) for step-by-step instructions for updating your apps.

### What's New

*  **Functions as Props** ‚Äì Use JavaScript functions from Python to customize charts, sliders, filters, dropdowns, and more
*  **New DatePicker** ‚Äì A calendar-only component with full support for multi-date, ranges, and custom disabled logic
*  **New TimePicker & TimeGrid** ‚Äì Better time selection with dropdowns, 12/24h formats, and predefined slots
*  **Simplified Notifications** ‚Äì Use `NotificationContainer` and the Mantine API directly in clientside callbacks
*  **Submenus in Menu** ‚Äì New nested menu support
*  **Carousel API updates** ‚Äì Now uses `emblaOptions` for full alignment with Mantine
*  **Component improvements** ‚Äì Updated `Switch`, better dropdown behavior, and more


### New: Functions as Props
You can now pass JavaScript functions to DMC components using:
```python
{"function": "yourFunctionName"}
```
This enables advanced use cases like:

- Custom chart tooltips and axis value formatting
- Smart search filters for Select and MultiSelect
- Custom option renderers with full React components
- Custom Slider scales and labels
- Dynamically disabled calendar dates

You can even pass options from Python:
```python
{"function": "formatTemp", "options": {"unit": "F"}}
```
Functions live in `/assets/*.js` under the global `window.dashMantineFunctions` object.

See the new [Functions As Props docs](/functions-as-props) ‚Äî includes working examples and a guide for getting help from AI if you don‚Äôt write JavaScript.


#### Example: Custom Slider Label + Scale
.. exec::docs.slider.scale
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/slider/scale.py, assets/examples-js/scale-label.js

#### Example: DatePicker: Disable All Except Fridays
.. exec::docs.datepicker.disabledates_function
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/datepicker/disabledates_function.py, assets/examples-js/disabled_dates.js

#### Example: MultiSelect: Custom Option with Components
.. exec::docs.multiselect.render_option
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/multiselect/render_option.py, assets/examples-js/render_option_multiselect.js


### New NotificationContainer component

Notifications are now handled by a single component: `NotificationContainer`. This replaces the previous
`NotificationProvider` + `Notification` approach with one that is more aligned with Mantine's implementation. Also, there is
now direct access to Mantine's  Notification API in clientside callbacks. 

Please see the new [Notification docs](/components/notification) for more details.



### New Menu with Sub Menus

.. exec::docs.menu.submenus
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/menu/submenus.py
    :defaultExpanded: false
    :withExpandedButton: true


### New TimePicker Component

New `TimePicker` component is an alternative to `TimeInput` that offers more features. It supports 24-hour and
12-hour formats, dropdown with hours, minutes and seconds, and more.

With Dropdown:

.. exec::docs.timepicker.withdropdown

With presets:

.. exec::docs.timepicker.presetsgroup

### DateTimePicker component changes
`DateTimePicker` component now uses `TimePicker` under the hood instead of `TimeInput`. You can now use all 
`TimePicker` features with `DateTimePicker` component.

The  `timeInputProps` is no longer available.  To pass props down to the underlying `TimePicker` you need to use `timePickerProps` prop.

Example of enabling dropdown and setting 12h format for time picker:


.. exec::docs.datetimepicker.time-picker-props


### New TimeGrid component
New `TimeGrid` component allows to capture time value from the user with a predefined set of time slots:


.. exec::docs.timegrid.simple

### New DatePicker component  

We've added a new `DatePicker` ‚Äî a calendar-only component with no input field. It's the base calendar used in components 
like `DateInput`, `DatePickerInput`, and `DateTimePicker`. Any configuration you can apply to `DatePicker` ‚Äî such as
multiple selection, min/max dates, week numbers, or disabled dates ‚Äî can also be used in those components.

[Read the full DatePicker docs ‚Üí](/components/datepicker)

.. exec::docs.datepicker.simple






### Popover Hide detached

Use `hideDetached` prop to configure how the dropdown behaves when the target element is hidden with styles 
(`display: none, visibility: hidden,` etc.), removed from the DOM, or when the target element is scrolled out of the viewport.

By default, `hideDetached` is enabled ‚Äì the dropdown is hidden with the target element. You can change this behavior
with `hideDetached=False`. To see the difference, try to scroll the container that holds the Popover components:


.. exec::docs.popover.hidedetached
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/popover/hidedetached.py
    :defaultExpanded: false
    :withExpandedButton: true



#### Carousel changes
The following props are removed.  They now need to be passed to embla using the `emblaOptions` prop
- `loop`
- `align`
- `slidesToScroll`
- `dragFree`
- `inViewThreshold`
- `skipSnaps`
- `containScroll`

```python
#  ‚ùå 1.x ‚Äì embla options passed as props no longer works in 2.x
dmc.Carousel(loop=True,  dragFree=True,  align="start")

# ‚úÖ 2.x ‚Äì use emblaOptions to pass options to embla
dmc.Carousel({ "loop": True, "dragFree": True, "align": 'start' })
```
Also, the `speed` and `draggable` props were removed ‚Äì they are no longer supported by embla

### Switch withThumbIndicator
Switch component styles were updated to include indicator inside the thumb. You can change it by setting `withThumbIndicator` prop:

.. exec::docs.switch.interactive
    :code: false



### Other changes
- [CodeHighlight](/components/code-highlight) - To reduce the bundle size only the top 10 languages are supported.  If you would like to include other, please open an issue on our GitHub
- DatesProvider timezone -DatesProvider component no longer supports timezone option ‚Äì all Mantine dates components now use strings in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss format as values and do not contain timezone information.
