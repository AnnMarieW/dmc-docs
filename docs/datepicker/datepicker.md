### DatePicker renamed

In dash-mantine-components 0.15.0 the `DatePicker` was renamed to  `DatePickerInput`.

> If your app used the `DatePicker` component in version 0.14, simply update it to `DatePickerInput` to reflect the new name.

Why the change? This renaming keeps us aligned with the upstream Mantine library. Mantine has two components:  
- `DatePicker`: A standalone calendar.  
- `DatePickerInput`: An input field with a dropdown calendar (similar to Dash Core Components' DatePickers).  

Stay tuned, we'll be adding Mantineâ€™s standalone `DatePicker` in a future release.
