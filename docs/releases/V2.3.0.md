### New DirectionProvider component

All Mantine components support right-to-left direction out of the box. You can preview how components work with RTL
direction by clicking direction control in the top right corner.

See the [RTL (right-to-left) direction](/rtl)  guide for details on enabling RTL text and adding a toggle to your app.


```python
app.layout = dmc.DirectionProvider(
    dmc.MantineProvider([
     # your app layout
     ]),
    direction="rtl"
)
```


### New in ScrollArea: `scrollTo` prop 

In the [ScrollArea](/components/scrollarea), you can now programmatically control the scroll position of the viewport.

  * `top` – The vertical position as pixels (number) or percentage (string) from '0%' to '100%'
  * `left` – The horizontal position as pixels (number) or percentage (string) from '0%' to '100%'
  * `behavior` – scroll behavior: `auto` (instant) or `smooth` (animated), `smooth` by default

### New (in the docs) Overlay component
