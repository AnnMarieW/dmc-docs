Released August 18, 2025

### What's New
 



### New ModalStack and DrawerStack components

Use [ModalStack](/components/modal) or [DrawerStack](/components/drawer) to render and manage multiple modals or drawers at once. These components handle focus, z-index stacking, and Escape key closing automatically.


.. exec::docs.modal.modalstack
    :code: false

.. sourcetabs::docs/modal/modalstack.py
    :defaultExpanded: false
    :withExpandedButton: true


### Calendar headerControlsOrder prop

Calendar-based components like [DatePicker](/components/datepicker) now support the `headerControlsOrder` prop, which lets you customize the layout of header buttons. The value is a dictionary using keys `'previous'`, `'next'`, and `'level'`.

.. exec::docs.datepicker.headercontrolsorder

### Quick Start

Just a reminder:

* With Dash ≥ 3.0.0, there’s no need to manually set the React version.
* With DMC ≥ 1.2.0, you no longer need to include optional stylesheets such as `dmc.styles.ALL`.

Here’s a minimal app to get started:

.. exec::docs.getting-started.hello_world
   :code: false

```python
import dash_mantine_components as dmc
from dash import Dash

app = Dash()

app.layout = dmc.MantineProvider(
    dmc.Alert(
        "Welcome to Dash Mantine Components",
        title="Hello!",
        color="violet",
    )
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
